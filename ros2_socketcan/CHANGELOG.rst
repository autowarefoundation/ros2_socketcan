* SocketCAN filters (`#25 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/ros2_socketcan/issues/25>`_)
  * SocketCAN filters
  Filters can be set using launch parameter.
  A list of pairs (can id and mask) are fetched and applied to
  socket filter.
  Added unit test for filters application and fuctionality.
  * Full support of SocketCAN filters
  SocketCAN filters can be now
  with string description used
  by candump utility.
  Added support for error masks
  and joined CAN filters.
  Instead of list of integers, receiver
  node now uses string parameter

  now be parsed and setup during
  configuration.
  Added unit test for parsing and
  updated filters unit test.
  * Reference to man-pages docs of filters syntax
  Added links referencing man-pages docs for candump,
  containing more information about socketcan filters
  syntax used. Links were added to doxygen documentation
  of filters parsing method and to launch argument
